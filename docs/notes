`src/main.cc`

- `gldwWindowHint` which sets the rules before the window exists. `gladLoadGLLoader` maps the function pointers to the graphic driver.

- vertex data management
    - VBO (Vertex Buffer Object) -> the raw memory on the GPU containing `points`
    - VAO (Vertex Array Object) -> a macro that records which VBO to use and how the data is formatted via `glVertexAttribPointer`

- render loop
    - `glClear` resets the frame buffer to the `glClearColor` to prevent ghosting from the previous frame.
    - `glDrawArrays` is the actual "GO" sign for the GPU

`include/shader.h`

- uses `std::ifstream` and `stringstream` to convert disk files int ostrings the CPU can read.
    - the `.exceptions()` call forces the program to handle missing files explicitly via `try-catch`

- compilation workflow
    - `glCreateShader` asks the GPU for a new shader slot.
    - `glShaderSource` uploads GLSL strings to that slot.
    - `glCompilerShader` translates GLSL into GPU machine code.

- linking combines the vertex and fragment stages into a single `ID` this is where the CPU checks if the OUT of the vertex shader matches the IN of the fragment shader.

- `glDeleteShader` is used to clear individual stage objects that are no longer needed once the program is linked saving GPU memory.
